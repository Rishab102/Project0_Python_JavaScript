Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My website is based on information related to SAP Leonardo.
It has total 4 web pages. One is the home page and other three pages are linked at home page and is accessible from home page.

From the three web pages we can come back to home page.

Index.html includes overview of SAP Leoanrdo.
I have used <a> anchor tags here to create link for other web pages of my website.
@media query is also used in css file for index.html file.
index.html also includes unordered and ordered list in it.
the home page has two style sheets. one named style.css and otehr is style1.css. style1.css is formed by style1.scss using command :- sass style1.scss style1.css
style.css includes varrious styles as per requirement.

I have used ids and classes for the same
I have also used bootstrap components for styling and have also used grid for styling.

ML.html includes table which has table headers and table rows in it.
In ML.html i have used bootstrap components such as 'class-3' for styling.

in all the web pages i have also used image tag i.e <img>

all the four webpages are interlinked with each other.

The whole website basically tells about the overview and insights of SAP Leonardo.
